# Bike-Sharing-Analytics

## Background
With an growing emphasis on reduction of traffic congestions, evironmental problems and health-related concerns, it has led to an increased interest in bike-sharing systems. These systems automate the entire process of membership, rental, and return, responding to the heightened demand. 

Today, there are over 500 bike-sharing programms worldwide, with over 500 thousand bicycles for sharing. Besides improving urban mobility, bike sharing programs are also a powerful tool for data collection. By tracking the movements of these bicycles, a virtual sensing network is formed, where the mobility patterns in the city can be monitored. Therefore, not only does it function as a sustainable transportation tool, but the data generated from tracking bike movements is also valuable for understanding urban mobility patterns. 

To ensure the continued success of this system, improvements and upgrades are necessary to sustain business operation and to keep it in line with current trends and demands.

## Problem Statement 
In this project, we aim to address the following problem: How do environmental factors, including holidays, seasonal variations, and weather changes, impact the number of bike rentals? Our goal is to thoroughly examine and understand the relationship between these factors and bike rental patterns.

## Project Objectives
As a member of the market research team for Leo Bike Share Co, the objective of this project is to find out the variation in consumer behavior by studying bike rental patterns and provide data driven suggestions that will help improve business operation for Leo Bike.
